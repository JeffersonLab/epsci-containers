Here we use the containerization feature of spack to create
a Dockerfile that can build Geant4 inside a docer image using
spack. This works by cloning spack to the local host and then
using it to generate a Dockerfile using the spack.yaml file in
this directory. That can then be used to build the docker
container with Geant4

Note that this requires using one of the spack-supplied base
images for the build. My understanding is that the final image
will have inherit from just the base ubuntu image and not the
spack supplied one. Thus, any extra system packages (like gcc
or python) must be installed via the spack.yaml and not
from some other base image we created.

Install spack and use it to create the Dockerfile like this:

git clone -c feature.manyFiles=true https://github.com/spack/spack.git
. spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
spack containerize >& Dockerfile.geant4.11.0.3
docker build -t epsci-geant4:11.0.3 -t jeffersonlab/epsci-geant4:11.0.3 -f Dockerfile.geant4.11.0.3 .
